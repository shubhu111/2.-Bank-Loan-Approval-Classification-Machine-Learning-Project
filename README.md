# Bank-Loan-Approval-Classification-Machine-Learning-Project
This machine learning project predicts whether a bank loan application will be approved or not, based on demographic, financial, and credit history data. The project implements multiple classification models, with a focus on achieving high accuracy using an optimized Stacking Algorithm.
# Project Overview
- Objective: To predict loan approval decisions using historical loan application data.
- Dataset: Contains 61,000+ records after balancing. Key features include applicant demographics, credit history, and financial attributes.
# Workflow
1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
- Analyzed data distributions and identified key correlations between features.
- Visualized missing values, outliers, and class imbalances to improve data quality.
2. Data Preprocessing:
- Handled missing values and treated outliers to ensure data consistency.
- Balanced the dataset using resampling techniques to address class imbalances.
- Standardized features using ```StandardScaler``` to optimize model performance.
